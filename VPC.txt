1) delete the default vpc
(REFRESH all below vpc like subnet etc)
2)create vpc(SNU-DC) with 192.168.0.0/16 network
3)create 2 subnets - AIDS(192.168.1.0/24) AND IOT(192.168.2.0/24) both in same AZ(AZ1 in this case)
4)create internet gateway(SNU-DC-IGW) and attatch to the SNU-DC VPC
5)rename route table to SNU-DC-Route-Table and then go to Edit routes and add routes
	choose 0.0.0.0/0 and internet gateway
6)create ec2 instances, one for aids and one for iot(allow security group for port 22 and 80,ICMP protocol)
	create instance with name AIDS-Web-Server and ubuntu and create key pair and .ppk for putty(SNU-DC-LAB.PPK)
	switch subnet to aids and enable auto assign public ip and change security group name to AIDS-Server-SG
	security group rule 2 to http and source type to anywhere
	ADVANCED NETWORK configuration 
		primary ip 192.168.1.4
	then launch instance
	After launching instance go to instances and copy public ip and open putty application
	put ip and then go to ssh auth credentials and put private key and go to session and default session and open
	and login with ubuntu and sudo apt update and sudo apt install net-tools then ifconfig sudo apt install apache2
	THEN cd /var/www/html/ then ls will show index.html then sudo chmod 777 index.html then echo "<h1>welcome to aids server</h1>" > index.html put public ip in google you will get website


do the same for iot server and then ping 192.168.2.4
